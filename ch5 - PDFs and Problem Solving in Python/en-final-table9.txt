household chores, or (b) children 12–14 years old who, during the reference week, did at least 14 hours of
economic activity or at least 28 hours of household chores.
Child marriage – Percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before they
were 15 years old and percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before
they were 18 years old.
Birth registration – Percentage of children less than 5 years old who were registered at the time of the

DEFINITIONS OF THE INDICATORS
MAIN DATA SOURCES
Child labour – Percentage of children 5–14 years old involved in child labour at the time of the survey. 
A child is considered to be involved in child labour under the following conditions: (a) children 5–11 years 
old who, during the reference week, did at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of 
household chores, or (b) children 12–14 years old who, during the reference week, did at least 14 hours of 
economic activity or at least 28 hours of household chores.
Child marriage – Percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before they 
were 15 years old and percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before 
they were 18 years old.
Birth registration – Percentage of children less than 5 years old who were registered at the time of the 
survey. The numerator of this indicator includes children whose birth certificate was seen by the inter-
viewer or whose mother or caretaker says the birth has been registered.
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) – (a) Women: percentage of women 15–49 years old who 
have undergone FGM/C; (b) girls: percentage of girls 0–14 years old who have undergone FGM/C (as 
reported by their mothers); (c) support for the practice: percentage of women 15–49 years old who have 
heard about FGM/C and think the practice should continue.
Justification of wife beating – Percentage of women and men 15–49 years old who consider a husband 
to be justified in hitting or beating his wife for at least one of the specified reasons, i.e., if his wife burns 
the food, argues with him, goes out without telling him, neglects the children or refuses sexual relations.

economic activity or at least 28 hours of household chores.
Child marriage – Percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before they 
were 15 years old and percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before 
they were 18 years old.

economic activity or at least 28 hours of household chores.
Child marriage – Percentage of women 20–24 years old who were first married or in union before they
